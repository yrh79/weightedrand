// Package weightedrand contains a performant data structure and algorithm used
// to randomly select an element from some kind of list, where the chances of
// each element to be selected not being equal, but defined by relative
// "weights" (or probabilities). This is called weighted random selection.
//
// There is an existing Go library that has a generic implementation of this as
// github.com/jmcvetta/randutil, which optimizes for the single operation case.
// In contrast, this package creates a presorted cache optimized for binary
// search, allowing repeated selections from the same set to be significantly
// faster, especially for large data sets.
